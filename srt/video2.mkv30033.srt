1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:03.120000
 going to describe language models.

2
0:00:03.120000 --> 0:00:09.360000
 Language models play a very important role

3
0:00:09.360000 --> 0:00:15.480000
 in natural language processing, both in the classical view

4
0:00:15.480000 --> 0:00:18.280000
 of natural language processing, but also

5
0:00:18.280000 --> 0:00:22.160000
 in the modern framework of deep learning.

6
0:00:22.160000 --> 0:00:25.240000
 OK, there are some different techniques

7
0:00:25.240000 --> 0:00:27.920000
 to develop language models.

8
0:00:27.920000 --> 0:00:30.920000
 But today, and today,
