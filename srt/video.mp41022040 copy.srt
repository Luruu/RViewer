 In Italy, in other parts of the world, notarium, vast spaces. Notarium in Italy is a person when we go, when we want to buy or to sell the house. The act must be registered on a architectural field called Notarium.

2
0:00:30 --> 0:01:00
 In fact, it is only adequate, along with something else. This is the characteristic of Italy and Spain only to carry in laws.

3
0:01:00 --> 0:01:30
 It is covered in 1929, back in the 1850s, only after 50 years, before dying, like this, the suns. And the film of utilisation,

4
0:01:30 --> 0:02:00
 it is the course of special arrogance, as in Italy and in the main emerged China's greatest problem.

5
0:02:00 --> 0:02:30
 It does for computing the minimum of maximum on the fraction without no flow. We can say that also this is a case of an orchestrate optimization.

6
0:02:30 --> 0:03:00
 The state of the station problem. Of course we quote only the theorem without the providing the proof

7
0:03:00 --> 0:03:30
 because we are not the DNA capacity to the proof. So what say the theorem and the format of the station problem? Let F be a fraction of n by

8
0:03:30 --> 0:04:00
 the most deflection of the points at start if a vegetable means that all the variables we respect on values exist of course. If x is that is a point or local extreme means a maximum per million or a fraction of f x.

9
0:04:00 --> 0:04:30
 Then the reflection of the function in both x, strata, df, df, x. It must be runicious, df, x, star, massly equal z and this act ends when all the parts of the real piece will respect all the random

10
0:04:30 --> 0:05:00
 values Divine sin actually defines. I will discuss theinchment.

11
0:05:00 --> 0:05:30
 Go to the next one by professor and in one hour you understand what does it mean. But, probably if we obtain our procedure, you will be able to understand.

12
0:05:30 --> 0:06:00
 Thank you very much.

13
0:06:00 --> 0:06:30
 So, we have seen the same.

14
0:06:30 --> 0:07:00
 If exist a maximum of a minimum and we call it generally x value in a 5x star, the differential of the function computed in the 5x star

15
0:07:00 --> 0:07:30
 and this implies sorry, but I am too close. That all partial derivatives with respect to all any different values

16
0:07:30 --> 0:08:00
 must be now. Of course, I have speaking about the function of F which and values. I am computing F is a variable that takes place in the

17
0:08:00 --> 0:08:30
 field. In the R, value N and in the space, the value feature of what you want and takes value in R. All R.

18
0:08:30 --> 0:09:00
 So, a point for which all derivatives are now that is called a staccional point. Staccional point in the end of the staccional point.

19
0:09:00 --> 0:09:30
 And interact this the usefulness of the optimization theorem consists in programming any total for finding the distribution of the points. How we like the system

20
0:09:30 --> 0:10:00
 in which each equation is a partial derivatives and the partial derivatives must be equal to 0.

21
0:10:00 --> 0:10:30
 We will not be losing the staccional line, the H and S are all about this staccional line. This staccional line will be losing the staccional line.

22
0:10:30 --> 0:11:00
 So, interact this we have a system of any equations in an unknown values. The N are known values.

23
0:11:00 --> 0:11:30
 We can solve it. Now, we see a problem from the
