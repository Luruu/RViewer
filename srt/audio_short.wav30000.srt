1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:03.080000
 going to describe language models.

2
0:00:03.080000 --> 0:00:09.340000
 Language models play a very important role

3
0:00:09.340000 --> 0:00:12.460000
 in natural language processing,

4
0:00:12.460000 --> 0:00:17.660000
 both in the classical view of natural language processing,

5
0:00:17.660000 --> 0:00:21.880000
 but also in the modern framework of deep learning.

6
0:00:21.880000 --> 0:00:25.240000
 Okay, there are some different techniques

7
0:00:25.240000 --> 0:00:27.680000
 to develop language models,
