 in Italy and Spain in other parts of the world, notary in Italy is a person when we go, when we want to buy or to sell a house, the act must be registered by a particular figure called notary.

2
0:00:30 --> 0:01:00
 Especially in Pakistan, in other parts, it is only adequate a lawyer or something else. This is the characteristic of Italy and Spain, only two countries involved. Do you know it? It was an unhappy firm.

3
0:01:00 --> 0:01:30
 It was discovered in 1629, but in reality it published only after 50 years before then, like this resource.

4
0:01:30 --> 0:02:00
 The idea of the firm here provides a little that now we can press to your brain for finding the meaning of the maximum of fashion defined in all states. Without any constraints, so firm up optimization here provides

5
0:02:00 --> 0:02:30
 a good for computing the minimum or maximum on the fashion without no constraints. We can say that also this is a case of anti-straight optimization problem.

6
0:02:30 --> 0:03:00
 Of course, we quote only the theorem without the providing the proof

7
0:03:00 --> 0:03:30
 because we are not really interested in the proof. So, what say the theorem and the firm up optimization problem? Let F be a function of N

8
0:03:30 --> 0:04:00
 recalls but OK

9
0:04:00 --> 0:04:30
 then the differential of the function in point x star dfx must be vanishes dfx star must be equal to z and this happens when all the partial derivatives with respect all the variables

10
0:04:30 --> 0:05:00
 vanishes are not I expect that do you know the partial derivative do you know the partial derivative do you know partial derivatives? yes

11
0:05:00 --> 0:05:30
 go to the restaurant by professor and in one hour you understand what does it mean but probably if you attend our procedure you will be able to understand so

12
0:06:00 --> 0:06:30
 so we are simply saying

13
0:06:30 --> 0:07:00
 if exist a maximum or a minimum and we call it generally extremum in a point x star the differential of the function computed in a point x star

14
0:07:00 --> 0:07:30
 must be now and this is rise sorry but I am too close that all partial derivatives with respect to all and different variables

15
0:07:30 --> 0:08:00
 must be now of course I am speaking about the function f which have n variables okay I am computing f is a variable that takes the

16
0:08:00 --> 0:08:30
 value in a parallel n and the space the number of features and what do you want and takes the value in a all up in general

17
0:08:30 --> 0:09:00
 so a point for which all the derivatives are now is called a stationary point stationary point in integral

18
0:09:00 --> 0:09:30
 and in practice the usefulness of a map optimization theorem consists in providing a method for finding the stationary points how we like the system

19
0:09:30 --> 0:10:00
 in which each equation is a partial derivatives and the partial derivatives must be equal to zero okay

20
0:10:00 --> 0:10:30
 we will not introduce other stuff like actions and so on but this stuff will be introduced by professor on the Charmander in the second sense for making computation more accurate about the vector equations but for us

21
0:10:30 --> 0:11:00
 we cannot consider the actions and so on so in practice we have a system of n equations in n unknown values the n unknown values are the numbers

22
0:11:00 --> 0:11:30
 of variables n equation in n values we can solve it now we skip other from

23
0:11:30 --> 0:12:00
 19 from 16 25 26 288

24
0:12:00 --> 0:12:30
 and there was another mathematician physicist mathematician French even he started and he was born in Curie the correct name in Italian was La Grand Gia but he started in France and it

25
0:12:30 --> 0:13:00
 was all the life in France and became so the question of a large

26
0:13:00 --> 0:13:30
 in 1688 provide a new term for solving the optimization problem we constrain it is not as adequate computing the maximum or the minimum but the way that you are able to compute

27
0:13:30 --> 0:14:00
 must satisfy a father constraints for example line on a plane or line on a circle and so on this is the classical code conditional optimization problem

28
0:14:00 --> 0:14:30
 okay or conditional optimization so how can we formulate it please if there is something that seems one of you stop me immediately

29
0:14:30 --> 0:15:00
 because in reality even you did this stuff in mathematical I am quite sure you have forgotten office probably the only person he remembered something is crowned highest

30
0:15:00 --> 0:15:30
 we have a fashion F that takes value in n dimensional space and takes value in and now there is no change with the respect

31
0:15:30 --> 0:16:00
 for firm optimization problem in reality this is not adequate because this fashion F we are M constraint represented by n equation g1 x g2

32
0:16:00 --> 0:16:30
 x gn x with this characteristic the second the right sorry the right side of the equation is now okay a constraint as a formula as a for a is must be formulated as an equation

33
0:16:30 --> 0:17:00
 in which the right side of the question must be now equal to zero but in reality the equation that it's press the constraints

34
0:17:00 --> 0:17:01.280000
 mass
